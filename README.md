# cEOS Playground

This repository is forked from diogo-arista ceos-101 repo.
In this repository I have added some basic networking labs intended to help learn networking concepts as well as have a baseline while troubleshooting network issues

I have also taken the topology and some config from Titom73's arista-eos-mpls-sr-evpn repository and modified it for simple protocol use cases

All individual labs are available in labs/ folder containing:
### 1. Containerlab topology file 
### 2. Topology Diagram
### 3. Init Config
### 4. Ansible playbook to load custom configs to troubleshoot different scenarios

To use this repo to test scenarios within github codespaces, please follow the instructions uploaded by diogo and start the relevant clab to get the  topology started
https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/Getting-Started-with-cEOS-lab-in-Containerlab

Detailed instructions will follow once more labs are uploaded and this repo becomes more mature
